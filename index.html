            <p>Consumerism is the predominant theme in my work. The purpose of my artwork is to pose a question for the audience to consider the value of consumer culture. My works are intended to represent a reflection of modern dilemma. My goal is to create an aesthetic experience and to provoke dialogue. I hope to investigate all aspects of consumerism within the context of constantly changing values that define our relationships and identities. </p>

                        <h3>The Gaze, mirror installation</h3>
                        <p>By learning Impressionism in Dorothy Barenscott’s class, Paris: The Art and Spectacle of Modern Life, I am interested in the idea of flaneur’s gaze. In our contemporary world, everyone acts as the flaneur, a passionate observer especially who use social media to create different kinds of persona and connect with others. Furthermore, our commodity culture influences our ways of seeing that is superficial, fleeting, and feminized. As a result, I am curious about what might happen if the flaneur sees his refection in the public space, and how he notices his identity either consciously or unconsciously. </p>

                        <p>To reflect our consumer culture, female identity is categorized even by colours. My work questions that what colour and text could generate types of female imagery in viewers’ minds. There are six cradle panels each painted different colour of nail polish. I name each cradled panel from different brands of nail polish, such as Essie’s After Sex, OPI’s Miss Bossy Pants, Sephora’s Going Nude, Eh? by OPI, and etc. The image remains abstract in colour, viewers are lured by the title to make any kind of associations. </p>

                        <h3>Obsession series, oil painting</h3>
                        <p>My canvases are like a mirror that reflects my own face. Using painting as my medium is essential because through the act of painting, I can define my own identity and subvert notions of ideal beauty. The transformation from advertising images to abstract paintings reveals my struggle to resist obsession with beauty. In my paintings, I want to immerse myself in the conflict of fitting in 'ideal' beauty rather than criticizing it in an extreme feminist way. In addition, Jenny Saville’s idea of self-examination inspires me to create the pieces. I admire Saville’s paintings because she is able to depict the physicality of the body that shows both power and vulnerability. </p>
